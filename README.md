# My bot

## Usage

Run `setup.sh` to deploy on [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
Make sure that you've installed [docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your machine.

## ToDo

+ Slack requires two users, the first has administration privilege and the second is for bot usage.
+ Access token, slack usernames and other configuration should be saved in one .json file under the project root.
